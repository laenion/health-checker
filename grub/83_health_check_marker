# them being not providing a way to modify anything done by previous scripts;
# unfortunately health_checker requires additional commands to be executed
# when selecting a boot entry (which is usually created by 10_linux), so as a
# horrible workaround the temporary output will be modified by a sed script.
#
# Will only work if output is redirected to a file (which should be the case
# in all automated cases), but not when the user is calling grub2-mkconfig by
# hand without redirection.
